Targil:
1. input two int numbers from the user, check if they are both zeros, if so print "both zeroes" otherwise print "not both zeroes"
2. input a,b,c (int) 
    check if all numbers are different from each-other, if so print "diff" otherwise print "similar"
3. input x,y,z (float)
    check and print how many of them are positive 
    for example: 
    for input of -1, 4 ,2.98 your program should print 2 positive numbers
    for input of -4.5, 0, -12 your program should print 0 positive numbers
4. input a, b, c. 
   print the biggest
   hint: if a is bigger than b and bigger than c --> a biggest
       else if b is bigger than c --> b biggest
       else --> c biggest
